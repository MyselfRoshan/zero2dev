# Changelog

## 0.0.1

First numbered release. Focus: isolation and portability.

- Portable: all data lives in `data/` next to the executable; the folder can be moved or copied.
- Nothing is written to the user profile, `AppData`, the registry or the OS trust store.
- Caddy runs isolated: its data and config are kept in `data/caddy`, its admin API is off, and its local CA is not added to Windows unless you ask.
- Caddy install fix (root cause found from the installer log): Caddy publishes SHA-512 checksums and the installer only understood SHA-256, so every Caddy install failed with "no checksum for ... in the published checksum file". SHA-256 and SHA-512 are now both verified.
- Other Caddy install hardening: retry when antivirus locks the extracted file, download timeouts and retries, a download proxy setting, full error messages that name the failing step, `data/logs/installer.log`.
- Import a runtime archive you downloaded yourself (verified against the published or a pasted SHA-256).
- Services, runtimes, sites, live logs and the embedded Svelte dashboard from the earlier prototype.
- Added `docs/USAGE.md`, a step-by-step guide with screenshots. The first-run page now says the token is in `data\token` next to the exe.
